        <h2>Web Development</h2>

        <p>I have just started learning web development. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time, but thought I would need to move to go to school.</p>
       <p>I was so excited to find Team Treehouse and the experience so far has been fantastic. I look forward to learning more, and will keep reminding myself that it's ok to be a beginner and I don't need to learn it all at once!</p>

        <h2>Snowboarding</h2>

        <p>Much as I could easily spend all my time behind a computer, it's important to get outside, and enjoy nature and exercise.</p>
       
        <p>I love being in nature and especially in the mountains. I enjoy the quiet of being surrounded by trees and snow, and also the energy of snowboarding and skiing.</p>

        <h2>Volunteering</h2>
        <img class="card-image" src="images/christopher-carson-i4XLJmlYit4-unsplash.jpg" alt="Image of a piglet" title="Piglet">
        <p>I have always had a soft spot for helping those in need, particularly animals.</p>
        <p>I am hoping that with my web development skills I will be able to do volunteer work for charities. I see many websites that could do with an overhaul and I hope to be able to help them out once I have the necessary skills and experience.</p>
